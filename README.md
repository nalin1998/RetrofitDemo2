# RetrofitDemo2
getting data from fake Rest API and displaying to our App

Some Info about App :-
Retrofit is an android / java library by the help of which we can send and receive data from a web service……it provides an attraction over the HTTP calls ….and when we make java interfaces and implement its methods it automatically generates the  networking code for us

Converters are library which convert the response we get from the server to java code
Converter we use :- GSON

Rest API ;- Web service which uses HTTP calls for client server interaction
Fake Rest API we use :- JSON Placeholder

On JSON Placeholder Website ;- 
Routes :- various URLs where we can get data from and make changes to that data


JSON ;- Data format we use to communicate between our App and the Server
